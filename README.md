Intro to Masternode Atomic Swaps


Masternode Automic Swaps

This is a open source to allow all masternode coin teams to work together to create a interface to allow the community to swap with each other their masternode for another masternode. This is a netural foundation that I have begun to emerge the community to work with each other to help to emerge in developing an Atomic Swap research and development team from each of the masternode community. I am reaching out to anyone that is looking into intergrating there coin to begin to find a solution to solve together to allow for each platform to be compatible to do atomic swaps not just for the masternode community but also to all coins.

This will enables everyone to bring something unique and creative to each find something that compel us to solve this great way for communities to interact with their investment and also to add more dimension to the fundermetal way on how we can exchange to a greater casue that be adapted to each coins future outcome.

We are also inviting Komodo a special team to be helping us to find the basics of how to set up and also to implememt the foundation for the atomic swap that would like to intergrate.
